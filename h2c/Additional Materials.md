# E. Discussion on the Long-Tail Phenomenon of Access Curves
In the previous sections, we mentioned that access curves to UGC objects have a long-tail phenomenon which means that access curves show downward trends on the whole, but we did not give a formulaic definition about it because it is hard to give a general formulation.
One reason is that access curves are uncertain even though historical information is known. The other is that although all access curves have a long-tail phenomenon, they have various trends among which there may be significant differences.
In this subsection, we formulate an access curve with the well-known Pareto distribution \[50\] and show that it is well-designed of Algorithm 1 for access curves having long-tail phenomenon. Suppose accesses to a UGC object with a lifetime of T follow the Pareto principle. That is, most accesses occur in the early 20% of its lifetime. Then we define the number of accesses per time slot occurred between time 1 and 0.2T.
The number of accesses at time t is denoted by $\mathcal{A}/x_t$, where $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the maximum number of accesses (i.e., $\mathcal{A} = \max_{1 \le t \le T} a(t)$) and $x_t$ is a Pareto random variable following the probability density function of
